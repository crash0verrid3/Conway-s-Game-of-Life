	REFLECTION:

This lab, for me personally, was rather easy to complete all in 1 class period, but DO NOT FOLLOW MY EXAMPLE of procrastinating for work. I was only able to complete this project in 1 class period because I have a LOT of prior experience programming. If you want to get this done well, allocate extra time to do this project. I guess it really comes down to this: Know yourself. If you can complete it quickly, then you may be able to get away with procrastinating, but it's still not a good idea.
